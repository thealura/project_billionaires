## Interpreting the Data
* The total number of billionaires over the last 20 years was 5,014. This seemed high to me. 
* Their total wealth had expected dips in 2009 and 2020, likely due to the housing crisis and the pandemic.
* I was definitely expecting there to be more male billionaires, but 8.9% seemed especially low for females. 
* The youngest billionaire is actually 20 now, and owns the largest drugstore chain in Germany.
* There appears to be a spike at age 38 when looking an average annual income. I'm past my prime!
* The top industries are (1) Finance & Investments, (2) Fashion & Retail, and (3) Real Estate.
* The top industry for females is Fashion & Retail. The top industry for males is Manufacturing.
